# Todo Tasks App

Todo Tasks App is a simple Marionette Application. This is meant for developers who want to understand Backbone and Marionette.

This uses basic script tags to load the library files and templates. I have intentionally done this not to add complexity and to focus only on the Mariontte and backbone.

+ This is a basic Marionette App with Mariontte View, Collection View, Backbone Model and Collection.
+ This App displays basic routing using Backbone Router.
+ Uses only script tags to load external libraries and templates for marionette views.
+ Does not use any Regions/View.
