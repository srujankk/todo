# Todo Tasks App

Todo Tasks App is a simple Marionette Application. This is meant for developers who want to understand Backbone and Marionette.

This uses basic script tags to load the library files and templates. I have intentionally done this not to add complexity and to focus only on the Mariontte and backbone.
